# genetic_optimisation C++ header file
**A versatile genetic optimisation tool for engineering design optimisation.**

The motivation to create a custom genetic optimisation tool is that many public optimisation libraries, such as NLOPT, lack the ability to handle
high number of optimisation variables and different data types, making them sub-optimal for engineering design optimisation.

This header file allows for practically limitless number of optimisation variables with different data type and supports unlimited linear and
non-linear equality and inequality constraints, ideal for engineering design optimisation.

The header file is located at [include/genetic_optimisation.h]()
